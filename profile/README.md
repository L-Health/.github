## Introduction

L-Health is an innovative diet recommendation app for people with acid reflux disease, designed to be their "go-to" app. L-Health's main goal is to provide personalized meal plan recommendations to help manage and alleviate acid reflux symptoms.

## Purpose and Features

### Food Recommendations
L-Health offers comprehensive food suggestions tailored to the specific needs of users with acid reflux. It includes detailed information about each food item, such as:
- Type of Food: Categorization of foods (e.g., gravy, grilled, fried, etc.).
- Taste: The flavor profile of the food (e.g., sweet, savoty, salty, etc).
- Acidity Level: The pH level of the food, indicating its acidity (e.g., low, medium, high).
- Protein Content: Amount of protein in the food.
- Carbohydrate Content: Amount of carbohydrates in the food.
- Hazard Level for the Stomach: An assessment of how safe or risky the food is for individuals with acid reflux (e.g., low, medium, high).

### Importance for Users
Individuals with acid reflux often struggle to find foods that do not aggravate their condition. Common triggers include acidic, spicy, or high-fat foods. L-Health aims to simplify meal planning by providing reliable recommendations that can help users avoid these triggers and maintain a balanced diet. By following the app's guidance, users can potentially reduce the frequency and severity of their acid reflux symptoms, leading to a better quality of life.

## How L-Health Works

- User Profile: Users create a profile detailing their dietary restrictions, preferences, and specific health conditions.
- Database of Foods: The app leverages a comprehensive database of foods, annotated with their nutritional and acidity information.
- Personalized Recommendations: Based on the user profile and the food database, L-Health generates customized meal plans and food suggestions.
- Educational Content: The app also provides educational resources about acid reflux, its triggers, and dietary management strategies.

## Conclusion
L-Health is more than just a diet app; it is a supportive tool designed to be a trusted ally for those managing acid reflux. By delivering personalized, science-backed dietary advice, L-Health helps users make informed food choices, ultimately aiming to improve their digestive health and overall well-being.
